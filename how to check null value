city_blank = 
IF(
    ISBLANK(dim_customer[City]) || dim_customer[City] = "",
    "Missing",
    "Available"
)

  don't use this way
    city_blank_2 = 
IF(
    ISBLANK(dim_customer[City]) ,
    "Missing",
    "Available"
) 
becuase this code get blank but if "" that mean have data and that is not true
